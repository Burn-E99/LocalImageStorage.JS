# LocalImageStorage.JS V0.0.0

A simple library designed to make saving commonly loaded images to localstorage.

LocalImageStorage.JS is designed to allow you to save PNGs to the web browser's localstorage so that future loads of your website are faster and require much less bandwidth.  This is especially useful when you need multiple clients to load the same set of images on a rotating set of pages when limited by network bandwidth and speed.
